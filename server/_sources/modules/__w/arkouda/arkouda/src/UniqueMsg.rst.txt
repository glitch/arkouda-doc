UniqueMsg
=========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use UniqueMsg;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import UniqueMsg;

unique finding and counting algorithms
these are all based on dense histograms and sparse histograms(assoc domains/arrays)

you could also use a sort if you got into a real bind with really
large dense ranges of values and large arrays...

*** need to factor in sparsity estimation somehow ***
for example if (a.max-a.min > a.size) means that a's are sparse



.. data:: const umLogger = new Logger()

.. function:: proc uniqueMsg(cmd: string, payload: string, st: borrowed SymTab): MsgTuple throws

   unique take a pdarray and returns a pdarray with the unique values 

.. function:: proc value_countsMsg(cmd: string, payload: string, st: borrowed SymTab): MsgTuple throws

   value_counts takes a pdarray and returns two pdarrays unique values and counts for each value
